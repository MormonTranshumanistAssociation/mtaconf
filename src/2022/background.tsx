                  Philosophers and political scientists have long debated the
                  challenge of balanced and sustainable governance. The problem
                  of collective action or preference coordination has kept power
                  sharing limited. For most of recorded history, humanity has
                  been compelled to choose between chaos and tyranny, with power
                  usually concentrated within a relatively small group led by a
                  single dictator.

                  More recently, representative democracy has begun to gain
                  favor over other more autocratic forms of government,
                  improving preference coordination but still demanding
                  significant compromises between expeditious execution and
                  broad consensus gathering. The technologies used for
                  democratic governance haven't undergone significant upgrades
                  since the American experiment nearly 250 years ago.

                  Recent innovations commonly referred to as Web3 have made it
                  possible to coordinate the preferences of large numbers of
                  people in real time while providing greater information
                  assurance than ever. In addition to preference coordination at
                  massive scale, more complex, novel forms of coordination can
                  be engineered that enable broader variety in the forms that
                  government may take and render obsolete the traditional
                  dichotomy of autocracy vs. anarchy. Constrained by the
                  guardrails of these new technologies, it becomes possible for
                  individuals and communities to pursue their own objectives
                  while also promoting the common welfare. While protocols for
                  decentralized governance are still in their infancy, they
                  already show great promise. These technologies will enable
                  corporations and countries to organize themselves more
                  effectively and to understand the will of their constituents
                  better and more instantaneously than before.

                  In addition to their potential benefit for the public and
                  private sectors, Web3 technologies offer a solution to the
                  problems posed by today's social media outlets, where
                  centralized control over network infrastructure creates
                  perverse incentives for value capture that weaken the social
                  commons. Adverse outcomes from this value capture include
                  disinformation campaigns, declines in mental health, election
                  manipulation and even genocide. Web3 enables user- and
                  community-owned social media alternatives that facilitate
                  robust social interaction in which stakeholder incentives are
                  properly aligned. A confluence of additional technological
                  innovations like video streaming, telepresence, mobile
                  broadband, and remote working, are enabling greater
                  collaboration with decreased reliance on centralized
                  infrastructure.

                  From an ethical perspective, it seems that the more we are
                  capable of distributing and decentralizing the exercise of
                  power while maintaining effective governance of shared
                  resources, the less potential there will be for abuse of
                  power, bureaucratic inefficiencies, or neglect of
                  disenfranchised individuals.

                  As religious transhumanists, we notice compelling theological
                  underpinnings to these trends. Mormon pioneers were well-known
                  for their resourcefulness, industry, and willingness to adopt
                  unconventional methods of governance, establishing numerous
                  settlements in the western frontiers of North America. The
                  restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was
                  governed by "common consent" (D&C 26:2), and the Book of
                  Mormon speaks of the necessity of individual agency and
                  responsibility, exhorting believers to avoid monarchy and "do
                  [their] business by the voice of the people" (Mosiah 29:26).
                  When asked how he was able to govern so many people
                  effectively, Joseph Smith replied, "I teach them correct
                  principles, and they govern themselves" (John Taylor, “The
                  Organization of the Church,” <em>Millennial Star</em>, Nov.
                  15, 1851, p. 339). Beyond its admonitions on earthly
                  governance, Mormon theology teaches that the destiny of every
                  follower of Christ is to be made "equal in power, and in
                  might, and in dominion" to God (D&C 76:95), thus prescribing
                  an optimal degree of power sharing and decentralization in the
                  governance of heaven.
