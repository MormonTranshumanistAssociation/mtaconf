                During the past year, innovations in machine learning and
                artificial intelligence have enabled these fields to go beyond
                being mere subjects of academic research to offer practical
                consumer applications that extend and enhance human abilities in
                various domains, including search, data processing, image
                recognition, speech, visual arts, translation, and writing.

                While previous labor-saving devices alleviated repetitive manual
                tasks, AI tools can solve more difficult problems that require
                enhanced predictive capacity, with the goal of extending human
                agency beyond its present constraints. Artificially intelligent
                agent services are emerging that increase productivity and
                extend the ability of individuals and organizations to respond
                rapidly to an ever broader variety of conditions. An increasing
                number of companies are coming to rely on these services to
                remain competitive in today's economic landscape.

                human intelligence, what constitutes real agency, and at what
                point it may be appropriate to extend human rights to artificial
                intelligence. It seems likely that we will eventually achieve
                artificial general intelligence (AGI), or intelligence that
                meets or exceeds that of humans.

                The path towards AGI is fraught with risk. While many experts
                are worried about runaway unaligned AI acting against human
                interests, others are equally concerned about excessive
                regulation and bureaucracy hindering the efforts of researchers
                and engineers, especially when such hindrances may delay human
                progress and impair the ability of democratic regimes to compete
                against autocratic powers that are less concerned about ensuring
                AI research is conducted ethically.

                As religious transhumanists, we notice compelling theological
                insights that may be drawn from these trends. In an 1833
                revelation, Mormon founder and prophet Joseph Smith declared,
                “The glory of God is intelligence.” Not only is intelligence the
                principle qualification of God; it is also the yardstick by
                which human godliness may be measured, and the epitome of
                posthuman development as descendants of God. Several additional
                theological insights related to the rise in artificial
                intelligence were shared by MTA President Carl Youngblood in his
                recent essay, “
