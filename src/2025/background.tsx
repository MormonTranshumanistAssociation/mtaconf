								As the rate of technological advancement accelerates, humanity
								is becoming increasingly aware of its capacity for improvement,
								both physical and spiritual, individual and collective. This
								awareness provokes profound awe as we contemplate the full range
								of human potential for transformation.

								“Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” (Romans 12:2)
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Transformation is not merely an abstract ideal. Mormon theology
								teaches that human minds, bodies, and spirits can be
								transfigured and perfected through Christ. This essential
								journey includes both spiritual growth and the unfolding
								potential of the human mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								In Mormon thought, the mind is regarded as an eternal, divine
								aspect of the soul, integral to the process of continual growth
								and transformation. The concept of eternal progression
								emphasizes that human beings are not static in their nature.
								Instead, they are capable of ongoing growth and
								transformation—spiritually, intellectually, and physically.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mormon doctrine teaches that humans are co-creators with God,
								made in the divine image and endowed with the potential to
								become more like God. This is not a metaphorical or distant
								possibility; it is a realistic goal within Mormon theology. The
								pursuit of perfection—both moral and intellectual—is a lifelong
								journey, where the mind plays an essential role. The divine plan
								involves the refinement and elevation of their minds, which
								aligns directly with the scriptural mandate to renew the mind
								continually. This renewal is not merely a spiritual
								transformation but an intellectual and cognitive one, as
								individuals strive to expand their understanding of the universe
								and their place within it.
							</p>
							<p>
								This vision of transformation resonates with the ethos of Mormon
								transhumanism—the belief that human beings can enhance their
								cognitive and physical capabilities to transcend natural
								limitations. Transhumanism, in this context, aligns seamlessly
								with Mormonism's doctrine of exaltation—the idea that humans can
								achieve divine qualities, including greater knowledge and
								wisdom. In Mormon thought, the mind is fundamentally designed
								for growth, not only in spiritual matters but in intellect as
								well. As technology advances, these tools can be seen as
								extensions of God’s plan for human progression. For instance,
								advancements in brain-computer interfacing, neural enhancements,
								and other cognitive technologies can aid in this eternal
								journey, aligning with the Mormon belief that the human
								mind—empowered by both divine grace and human effort—can
								continually evolve toward perfection.

							<p>
								Thus, Mormon theology supports a holistic view of
								transformation, where spiritual renewal and technological
								progress are not in conflict but are complementary. By embracing
								both ancient spiritual principles and modern scientific
								advancements, Mormons believe they can more fully realize their
								divine potential. The renewal of the mind, as expressed in
								Romans 12:2, invites us not only to transform our hearts but
								also to enhance our intellectual capacities, aligning both with
								God’s will for human growth.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just as the renewing of the mind has spiritual significance in
								Mormon thought, advances in technology raise new possibilities
								for cognitive transformation. Recently, Neuralink has made
								headlines by developing neural interfaces that allow direct
								interaction between the brain and machines, offering potential
								for restoring lost neurological functions and even enhancing
								human cognition. These innovations offer a new dimension to the
								Mormon belief in the perfectibility of the human mind—an
								extension of the idea that God has endowed us with remarkable
								capacities for growth, both in the spiritual and physical
								realms.
							</p>
							<p>
								This topic bridges the gap between traditional religious thought
								and emerging technologies, exploring the intersection of faith,
								science, and human potential. The Mormon Transhumanist
								Association seeks to understand how these technologies can
								enhance the process of transformation that is so central to
								Mormon theology. Whether through mindfulness, brain-computer
								interfaces, or psychedelic therapies, these tools hold the
								potential to deepen our understanding of divine transformation
								and empower us to achieve greater levels of intellectual and
								spiritual renewal.
							</p>
							<p>
								As we consider these diverse approaches to
								transformation—whether through spiritual practice or scientific
								innovation—we are confronted by important questions. What does
								it really mean to be “transformed by the renewing of our minds”
								in the context of both faith and technology? How can we use
								these new tools to fulfill the divine potential outlined in
								Mormon teachings and embrace the promise of eternal progress?
