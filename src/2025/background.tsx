								“Just as science in the 20th century was transformed by the
								discovery of DNA, so science and medicine in the 21st century

								The field of neuroscience is evolving at a breathtaking pace,
								driven by interdisciplinary efforts that merge biology,
								engineering, and computational science. Innovations such as
								brain–machine interfaces now translate neural signals into
								commands for robotic limbs, offering new hope for restoring
								mobility in individuals with paralysis. At the same time,
								breakthroughs in connectomics and high-resolution imaging are
								revealing the intricate wiring of neuronal circuits and the ways
								in which these networks govern both behavior and disease.
								Researchers have expanded their focus beyond neurons to include
								glial cells, whose roles in inflammation and synaptic support
								are proving essential for understanding and potentially treating
								disorders. Additionally, the development of brain organoids from
								human stem cells is providing unprecedented models for studying
								neurodevelopmental disorders and designing personalized
								treatments. Complementary approaches—ranging from the promising
								effects of psychedelics on brain connectivity to the analytical
								power of computational neuroscience and AI—are deepening our
								understanding of neural network function, dysfunction, and
								repair, while emerging fields like the gut–brain axis, advanced
								neuroimaging, and precision medicine continue to broaden the
								horizon of what is possible.

								Beyond therapeutic applications, emerging techniques are opening
								doors to improved mental and spiritual capacities. Neurofeedback
								and noninvasive brain stimulation offer new methods to boost
								attention, memory, and emotional resilience by harnessing the
								brain’s natural plasticity. Research into meditation and other
								contemplative practices has already begun to map the neural
								underpinnings of mindfulness and empathy, suggesting that
								deliberate mental training can profoundly reshape brain
								function. Similarly, controlled applications of psychedelics are
								showing potential for inducing transformative shifts in
								consciousness and self-awareness. With wearable EEG devices and
								virtual reality platforms now providing immediate, interactive
								feedback on one’s inner state, we are witnessing a convergence
								of technology and introspection that promises to elevate
								cognitive and emotional well-being.

								This fusion of scientific innovation with the quest for personal
								transformation has broader implications, inviting us to rethink
								what it means to be human. As new therapies and enhancements
								emerge, humanity is increasingly aware of its potential for
								growth—physical, mental, and spiritual. This growing awareness
								inspires both awe and a sense of responsibility as we confront
								the full spectrum of human potential for transformation.

								In this context, the biblical exhortation from Romans 12:2, “Be
								transformed by the renewing of your mind,” resonates not only as
								a spiritual ideal but also as a call to embrace the
								transformative power of modern science.

								Religious transhumanists, and particularly those within the
								Mormon tradition, find a compelling synthesis between timeless
								spiritual principles and contemporary technological advances. In
								Mormon theology, the transformation of body and spirit is not
								merely symbolic but is understood as a concrete, ongoing process
								of eternal progression—a journey in which the mind plays a
								crucial role. Mormon doctrine teaches that humans, created in
								God’s image, are co-creators with divine potential, an idea that
								aligns closely with modern aspirations for cognitive and
								spiritual enhancement. As Mormon cosmology unites the physical
								and spiritual realms into a single, comprehensible order, the
								transfiguration envisioned in latter-day revelation becomes
								comprehensible in part through the diligent study of science and
								the human arts. This holistic vision suggests that spiritual
								renewal and technological progress are mutually reinforcing,
								each offering unique insights into the divine potential inherent
								in every individual.

								“If there was a point where man in his progression could not
								proceed any further, the very idea would throw a gloom over
								every intelligent and reflecting mind. God himself is increasing
								and progressing in knowledge, power, and dominion, and will do
								so, worlds without end. It is just so with us.” (Wilford
								Woodruff, Church President)

								Mormon Transhumanism bridges the gap between traditional
								religious thought and emerging technologies by asserting that
								human growth—intellectual, moral, and spiritual—is limitless. We
								wish to actively explore how mindfulness, brain–computer
								interfaces, and novel medical therapies can work in concert to
								further the process of divine transformation. Ultimately,
								whether through contemplative practice or scientific innovation,
								the quest to “renew the mind” challenges us to consider how best
								to realize our fullest potential and embrace the promise of
								eternal progress.{" "}
