								The field of neuroscience is evolving at a breathtaking pace,
								driven by interdisciplinary efforts that merge biology,
								engineering, and computational science. Innovations such as
								brain–machine interfaces now translate neural signals into
								commands for robotic limbs, offering new hope for restoring
								mobility in individuals with paralysis. At the same time,
								breakthroughs in connectomics and high-resolution imaging are
								revealing the intricate wiring of neuronal circuits and the ways
								in which these networks govern both behavior and disease.
								Researchers have expanded their focus beyond neurons to include
								glial cells, whose roles in inflammation and synaptic support
								are proving essential for understanding and potentially treating
								disorders. Additionally, the development of brain organoids from
								human stem cells is providing unprecedented models for studying
								neurodevelopmental disorders and designing personalized
								treatments. Complementary approaches—ranging from the promising
								effects of psychedelics on brain connectivity to the analytical
								power of computational neuroscience and AI—are deepening our
								understanding of neural network function, dysfunction, and
								repair, while emerging fields like the gut–brain axis, advanced
								neuroimaging, and precision medicine continue to broaden the
								horizon of what is possible.

								Beyond therapeutic applications, emerging techniques are opening
								doors to improved mental and spiritual capacities. Neurofeedback
								and noninvasive brain stimulation offer new methods to boost
								attention, memory, and emotional resilience by harnessing the
								brain's natural plasticity. Research into meditation and other
								contemplative practices has already begun to map the neural
								underpinnings of mindfulness and empathy, suggesting that
								deliberate mental training can profoundly reshape brain
								function. Similarly, controlled applications of psychedelics are
								showing potential for inducing transformative shifts in
								consciousness and self-awareness. With wearable EEG devices and
								virtual reality platforms now providing immediate, interactive
								feedback on one's inner state, we are witnessing a convergence
								of technology and introspection that promises to elevate
								cognitive and emotional well-being.

								This fusion of scientific innovation with the quest for personal
								transformation has broader implications, inviting us to rethink
								what it means to be human. As new therapies and enhancements
								emerge, humanity is increasingly aware of its potential for
								growth—physical, mental, and spiritual. This growing awareness
								inspires both awe and a sense of responsibility as we confront
								the full spectrum of human potential for transformation.

								“Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” (Romans 12:2)

								Religious transhumanists are reminded of the admonition of Paul:
								“Be transformed through the renewal of your mind” (Romans 12:2).
								Transformation is not merely an abstract ideal; it is a
								foundational principle in Christianity, which emphasizes the
								importance of individual repentance and spiritual rebirth. Given
								dominion over creation, humans become co-creators with God, made
								in the divine image and endowed with the potential to grow in
								godliness. This is not a metaphorical or distant possibility; it
								is a realistic, concrete goal. Eternal progression—both moral
								and intellectual—is a constant journey in which the mind plays
								an essential role.

								Mormon cosmology unites the physical and spiritual into a single
								order of existence in which all forms are ultimately discernible
								and comprehensible. The transfiguration of body and spirit
								spoken of in latter-day revelation occurs in the same universe
								we presently inhabit and is achieved through a deep
								understanding and mastery of the relevant scientific and moral
								laws, with the help of God, whose constant grace makes this
								ongoing progress possible. Diligent study of human arts and
								sciences is an essential aspect of this process.{" "}
							</p>
							<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 text-xl text-green-600 font-semibold italic my-4">
								“If there was a point where man in his progression could not
								proceed any further, the very idea would throw a gloom over
								every intelligent and reflecting mind. God himself is increasing
								and progressing in knowledge, power, and dominion, and will do
								so, worlds without end. It is just so with us.” (Wilford
								Woodruff, Church President)
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								These theological principles thus support a holistic view of
								transformation, where spiritual renewal and technological
								progress are not in conflict but are complementary. By embracing
								both timeless spiritual principles and modern scientific
								advancements, Latter-day Saints believe they can more fully
								realize their divine potential. The renewal of the mind, as
								expressed in Romans 12:2, invites us not only to transform our
								hearts but also to enhance our intellectual capacities, aligning
								both with God's will for human growth.
